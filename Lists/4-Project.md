* **Whisper-to-stable-diffusion**. [[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fffiloni/whisper-to-stable-diffusion)] 
    * >***Whisper*** is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio. It is also a multi-task model that can perform multilingual speech recognition as well as speech translation and language identification.
    * >***Stable Diffusion*** is a state-of-the-art text-to-image model that generates images from text.
* ⭐⭐**Stable Diffusion 2.0**. [[Github](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion)] [[Website](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-v2-release)] [[Stability AI API Platform](https://platform.stability.ai/)] [[DreamStudio Beta](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream)]
    * >***New Text-to-Image Diffusion Model:*** Generates images with default resolutions of both 512x512 pixels and 768x768 pixels and remove adult content using LAION’s NSFW filter.
    * >***Super-resolution Upscaler Diffusion Model:*** Enhances the resolution of images by a factor of 4.
    * >***Depth-to-Image Diffusion Model:*** Depth2img infers the depth of an input image (using [an existing model](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS)), and then generates new images using both the text and depth information. New images look radically different from the original but still preserve the coherence and depth of that image.
    * >***Updated Inpainting Diffusion Model:*** A new text-guided inpainting model, fine-tuned on the new Stable Diffusion 2.0 base text-to-image, which makes it super easy to switch out parts of an image intelligently and quickly.
